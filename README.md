# TOPTW using single solution based metaheuristics
The Team Orienteering Problem is a routing problem on a graph with durations associated to the arcs and profits assigned to visiting the vertices. This problem considers among NP-Hard problems and one of the favorite tools to solve them is metaheuristics. In this project we used three kinds of metaheuristics algorithms:
- SA (Simulated Annealing)
- GRASP
- TS (Tabu Search)
  
## Usage:
1. Clone this repo using `git clone https://github.com/hoseinmrh/TOPTW-Single-Solution-Based`
2. Create a folder called `Instances` and put your instance there.
3. To run each algortim go to its main file. For example `mainSA.CPP`.
4. Put your file name and then run it using `g++ -O3 .\main.cpp -o main` command.
